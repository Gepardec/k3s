= Status of the PXE-Module:

== Automatic SD card generation

* static IP - done
* SSH enabled - done

done, static ip can now be set as an ansible variable
if dd 'writes' with 3GBs and no files appear on the card you might need to reboot the machine.

== Setting up a new user

* regenerating host SSH-Keys - done
* creating new user from vault file - done
* deleting pi user
* forcing passwordless access

== Choosing setup procedure for pxe server

* collecting methods (1/4)
* testing method (0/4)
* if we get one method and are happy its enough

== Hardware

Previously the dev setup was one RPi connected via lan to the dev machine.
For PXE dev I use two RPis and all machines are connected to a router(WRT54GL).
That way I can connect to both pi via ssh.
Additionally, I can monitor the network traffic with wireshark.
