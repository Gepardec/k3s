== Overview

=== The Acronym
DHCP means Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

=== Why
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks.

=== Goals
* The DHCP module provides a DHCP server.
* The DHCP server can be setup via ansible.
* The DHCP server is also available as a docker image.
