Definition of Done
****************************

Our Definition of Done consists of 3 main pillars

- Functional requirements are met and automated via ansible
- Documentation is complete and contains a description, a plan and step by step instructions
- Marketing: a blog post on our homepage and LinkedIn post by everyone referencing our work

-------------------------------

Functional requirements
##########################

Funcitonality as specified in the related ticket has been 

- implemented for RHEL based Linux distributions, 
- tested and automated with ansible
- via a pipeline that can push slack notifications if it breaks.


In addition to the met functional requirements the feature branch containing the added functionality has been merged back to master and installed on our infrastructure.

Ansible roles
--------------

If we end up creating our own ansible role we publish our ansible roles on ansible galaxy for everyone to use: https://galaxy.ansible.com/gepardec

------------------

Documentation
##############

We put our focus on well crafted documentation off our work to help ourselves and others. As such we value clearly structured documentation for each issue containing

- What we want to achive
- How we plan to achive our goal
- Step by Step instructions
- What didn't work / Why not X?

and publish it as github page at https://gepardec.github.io/k3s

------------------

Marketing
###############

Gepardec provides us with the time to learn and we on the other hand share with everybody we know what we at gepardec can do and why we are the right company for the job when it comes to Java EE and Cloud Migrations. We can do that by

- publishing our lessons learned as a blog post on gepardec.com
- and every one of us posts a reference to the blog post on our LinkedIn account
