Goals
****************************

We as a company have an excellent skillset in regard to **developing state of the art Java EE** applications. With a shift towards **DevOps** and continually increasing demand for **reduced time to market**, **scalability** and **reliability** of applications and infrastructure we are expanding our skillset in the area of **cloud**. In particular **Kuberentes** based container orchestration and its sorrounding tool landscape.

**We believe in learning by doing**. As such we face the challenge of improving our skillset with a Learning Friday project dedicated to Kubernetes infrastructure. During this project we plan to create our own Kubernetes Cluster on Raspberry Pi's from scratch with all the infrastructure required to make it work and automate it all with ansible. In addition to privisioning our own Kuberentes cluster we plan to create an application running on kubernetes capable of turning LEDs connected to the worker nodes on and off via a rest api.

To increase awareness of our company and **to showcase our skillset** we publish our documentation and learnings here, on our blog and via LinkedIn.

At the end of the project we will have at least 3 employees with the skillset required to pass the **Kubernetes Certified System Administrator** (KCSA) Certification.

This in turn will allow us as a company to become a **Certified Kubernetes Service Partner** (CKSP).
